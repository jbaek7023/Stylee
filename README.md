**Stylee** is a Social Network Platform which allows user to organize and socialize around your fashion style and clothing. This is NOT a school project but a project for my interest. I built everything on my own.

## TLDR; Long Story
**I was thinking about what will be the next Facebook or Instagram in next 4 years.** Every day before I went to bed, I wrote down at least one idea of the next social network service or next generation of mobile apps would be. And I thought I'd make an app for myself. I wasn't very well dressed, so I thought I'd make an app that would help me dress well.

In short this took me to...

- Wrote **65+ APIs** and **56+ pages**(screens) in **4 months**
- Finished **3 nanodegrees** (Udacity) and **9** Udemy courses in **8 months**
- Attended **3 hackathon**, and met brilliant people who have same interest as mine (Met entrepreneurs, designers and software engineers).
- Read bunch of deep learning papers (7 papers?; only 3 of them were useful) for Regional Convolutional Neural Network. (When I built this app, R-CNN wasn't popular and still under a research. It was often called as 'Darknet')

## Interviews, Business Model, UI/UX, Tech Stack Research

I interviewed 13 people for idea pitching and 3 people for UI testing.
